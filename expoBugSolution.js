Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **Check for Port Conflicts:**
   - The Expo development server typically runs on port 19000 or 19001. Use `netstat -a -b` (Windows) or `lsof -i :19000` (macOS/Linux) to check if another process is using these ports.  If a conflict exists, terminate the conflicting process or change the port Expo uses.

2. **Verify Network Configuration:**
   - Ensure your network connection is stable. Test the connection by accessing online resources. Network connectivity problems can prevent the development server from starting.

3. **Examine the Expo CLI logs:**
   - Carefully read the complete error output from the `expo start` command. The logs often provide valuable clues about the root cause. Search for specific error messages related to dependencies or network issues.

4. **Check Dependencies:**
   - Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to ensure all project dependencies are properly installed. Outdated or corrupt dependencies can lead to errors.

5. **Restart the computer:**
   - A simple reboot can sometimes resolve underlying issues that prevent the server from starting.

6. **Check the Expo CLI Version:**
   - Ensure you are using a recent and stable version of the Expo CLI. Run `expo --version` to check. Update if needed.

7. **Create a New Project:**
   - As a last resort, create a fresh Expo project and compare its behavior to your existing project to rule out issues in your project's configuration.
